it's  a pic ,no description 
HINT: Is anything dark here? Light it maybe? How? Got programs for that? Do you see something now? What sort of code could   it be?


<!-- Your solution. Use simple english. Do remember that all of this data is meta and won't matter. Add the answer too, if the level has it. -->
**Solution** : 
So , all the user basically has to do is observe the picture carefully,once they know it's morse code , well they cant really decipher it can they ? their only option is to look for some translator on google and for that the site has a search bar right there in the UI(didn't work for me though) . The first line is the usrname , the second being the password
Once that is done you click on the glowing object on the bed for the prompt.
