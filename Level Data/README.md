# Level Adding Guidelines #

First things first, all level data files should be markdown formatted, having  **.md** extension. Make yourself acquainted with Markdown's [Syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

Files should be named something like *Level_i.md*. Any other asset (images, audio etc.) used on that level should be named - *Level_i_Asset*.

Place files in **your** respective folders.

Have a look at this [sample](/Zafar/Level_1.md).

There is a Level_1.md file in each of the directories. It is filled with comments, explaining the entire template. Do **stick** to it.

Let's get this shit done.
