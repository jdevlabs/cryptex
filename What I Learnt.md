* Not everyone uses hints.
* The game should not be created with noobs in mind - GO HARD.
* Level 5 - Ceaser was easy.

* Level 4 - Was time consuming due to case sensitivity
* The game should be ENTIRELY CASE INSENSITIVE.

* People need REAL hints when they get stuck
* timeSpent = time() - time(gameStarted)
